# My First Flutter App [Todo App]

This is a simple Flutter application that allows you to create and manage tasks.

## Features

The Todo App provides the following features:

- Create tasks: You can add new tasks by tapping the add button and entering the task title.
- Task completion: Mark tasks as completed by tapping the checkbox next to each task. The completed tasks will have a line-through decoration.
- Delete tasks: You can delete a task by long-pressing on it.
- Task details: Each task displays the title, the date and time it was added, and a checkbox to toggle completion status.

## Dependencies

The Todo App relies on the following dependencies:

- `flutter/material.dart`: Provides the UI components and Material Design theme.
- `intl`: Used for date and time formatting.

Make sure to include these dependencies in your Flutter project's `pubspec.yaml` file before running the app.

## Usage

When the app starts, you will see an empty list of tasks. To add a new task, tap the text input field labeled "Create Task". Enter the title of the task and tap the add button.

The newly added task will appear at the top of the task list. You can mark a task as completed by tapping the checkbox next to it. To delete a task, long-press on it.

The app uses a dark theme by default, providing a visually appealing and focused environment for managing your tasks.
